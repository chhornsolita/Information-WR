embadding dim size = no limit depend on weight since we train in Nueral Network

embadding value :
   - positive = samantic meaning
   - negative = opposite meaning

KNN cannot use with duplicate data

1. Linear Models
1.1. Linear Regression
1.1.1. EDA
horsepower type object is not right cuz its data is in number
origin : type int64 in not right cuz its data is in letter(ex. usa..... and we need to encode it into number usa=1,.....)

1.1.1. EDA: Bivariate analysis

 make sure to plot this graph with quantitative data(number data)
 origin column must use to predict mpg
  When we use polynomail feature they introduce with regularization

1.1.4. Regularization: Ridge Regression
 Magnitde use for make coefficients smaller

 Issue	In MPG dataset	Ridge helps by
Multicollinearity	weight ↔ horsepower ↔ displacement	shrinking coefficients
Small dataset	only ~400 rows	reducing overfitting
Large coefficients	unstable predictions	stabilizing the model

Use Cross validation to choose alpha value

Cross validation use to 

Decision tree is similar to KNN

pureness 

KNN, Decision tree afraid of duplicated data
